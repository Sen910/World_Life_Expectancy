# World_Life_Expectancy & US_HouseHold_Income


This repository focuses on data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using the World Life Expectancy dataset with SQL. We will clean and preprocess the dataset to ensure accuracy and consistency, followed by analyzing the data to uncover patterns, trends, and key insights related to life expectancy across countries and regions.

# Tech Stack
MySQL Workbench: was used for data cleaning, gaining insights, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) by allowing efficient query writing, data manipulation, and analysis of the World Life Expectancy dataset. It provides tools for data preprocessing, detecting inconsistencies, and visualizing trends, helping to uncover key patterns and insights.

# Functionalities

**Data Cleaning**:
**Objective**: Ensure data quality and integrity.

- **Remove errors and inconsistencies:** Fix or eliminate incorrect, incomplete, or redundant data.
- **Handle missing values:** Identify and decide how to treat missing data (e.g., imputation, removal).
- **Standardize formats:** Ensure uniformity in data (e.g., consistent date formats, text capitalization).
- **Identify and address outliers:** Detect unusual data points and decide whether to keep, modify, or exclude them.
- **Improve reliability:** Make data suitable for analysis by ensuring it accurately represents the real-world scenario.


 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
 
**Objective**: Understand the data and uncover patterns, trends, and relationships.

**Key Aims:**
- **Gain insights:** Identify key variables, trends, distributions, and anomalies in the data.
- **Understand relationships:** Explore correlations and interactions between variables.
- **Check assumptions:** Verify assumptions for statistical modeling (e.g., normality, linearity).
- **Guide further analysis:** Develop hypotheses or refine research questions based on observed patterns.
- **Select modeling techniques:** Decide on appropriate analytical methods or machine learning models.
- **Visualize data:** Use graphs and charts to communicate the data's story effectively.



# Insights


1. **Life Expectancy Trends Over Time:**
   - Life expectancy has generally increased over the past few decades due to advances in healthcare, nutrition, and sanitation.
   
2. **Regional Differences:**
   - Significant disparities in life expectancy between regions, with higher life expectancy in developed countries (e.g., Europe, North America) compared to developing countries (e.g., Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia).
   
3. **Impact of Socio-Economic Factors:**
   - Countries with higher income levels, better healthcare systems, and education tend to have higher life expectancies.
   
4. **Correlation with Healthcare Indicators:**
   - Life expectancy often correlates with healthcare factors such as infant mortality rates, access to healthcare services, and vaccination rates.

5. **Outliers and Anomalies:**
   - Identification of outlier countries with unusually high or low life expectancies, which might be due to factors like conflict, disease outbreaks, or exceptionally high-quality healthcare.

6. **Population Growth and Life Expectancy:**
   - In some regions, rapid population growth may be impacting life expectancy, particularly in countries facing challenges in healthcare infrastructure

   

1. **Household Income Trends:**
   - Household income in the U.S. has shown steady increases over the years, but the growth rate has varied significantly across different income groups.

2. **Income Distribution:**
   - There is a significant disparity in household income, with a large portion of income concentrated in the top earners. This often results in an increased wealth gap between different socio-economic classes.

3. **Income by Region:**
   - Household income levels vary significantly across different U.S. regions. Coastal cities and major metropolitan areas tend to have higher median household incomes, while rural areas, particularly in the South and Midwest, show lower average household incomes.

4. **Impact of Inflation and Cost of Living:**
   - While household income has grown, the rising cost of living, particularly in urban areas, has reduced the purchasing power of many U.S. households. This is particularly evident in housing, healthcare, and education costs.

5. **Income Brackets:**
   - A significant portion of the U.S. population still falls within the **lower and middle-income brackets**, with only a small percentage reaching the highest income levels.

6. **Income and Poverty Rates:**
   - Despite increases in overall household income, poverty rates remain high in certain demographic groups, particularly in minority communities.
